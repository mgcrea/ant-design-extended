AntDesign Extended aka. `antd-extended` is an add-on to the amazing [ant-design](https://ant.design/) library that adds a few key things that you might find useful. For example:

- `antd-extended` adds new size breakpoints that you can use in almost every component, `x-small`, `x-large` and `xx-large`, which enables you to build a wider range of user interfaces.

- `antd-extended` adds `utc` and `startOf` props to easily sanitize date or time based components.

Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking with exported types along the library.

## Usage

```bash
npm install @mgcrea/antd-extended --save
# or
yarn add @mgcrea/antd-extended
```
